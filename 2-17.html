    The apartment was cheap in a way Brett didn’t question—
and later wished he had.

It sat quietly at the end of Hollis Lane, the building older than the surrounding shops, its paint dull and peeling despite recent attempts to make it look welcoming. The landlord spoke quickly, avoided eye contact, and mentioned the rent twice, as if afraid Brett might change his mind.

Raj stayed close to his father as they stepped inside.

The air smelled faintly of dust and old wood. Sound behaved strangely there—footsteps seemed softer than they should have been, voices lingering a fraction of a second too long.

Raj noticed the painting almost immediately.

It leaned against the wall near the stairs, half-covered by a yellowed cloth. When Raj pulled it aside, his breath caught.

Two children were painted holding hands.

One was whole. The other… wasn’t.

The canvas had been torn where the boy’s eyes should have been. Not ripped violently, but carefully, deliberately. The edges were rough but controlled, as if whoever had done it had taken their time.

Only the lower half of the face remained.
A mouth.
A chin.
Still.

Brett followed Raj’s stare and frowned. “That’s creepy,” he muttered. “Previous tenants probably left junk.”

He reached for the frame.

Raj grabbed his wrist.

“No.”

The word came out sharp, urgent—far louder than Raj meant it to be.

Brett looked down at him, surprised. “Raj?”

Raj didn’t know why he’d stopped him. He didn’t like the painting. It made his stomach twist. But the idea of it being gone felt worse—like losing something important without knowing why.

“It shouldn’t be thrown away,” Raj said quietly.

Brett studied him for a long moment, then sighed. “Fine. But it goes in your room.”

That night, the painting hung opposite Raj’s bed.

Raj turned his face toward the wall before sleeping.
Still, when he woke in the middle of the night, his eyes were already on it.
  </p>

  <p>
   A few nights later, Brett woke suddenly.

Thud.

The sound was heavy, final.

Rain tapped softly against the windows, steady and unhurried. The apartment lay in darkness, the kind that felt thick rather than empty.

Brett stepped into the hallway.

At the bottom of the stairs, the wall clock lay face-down.

The glass hadn’t shattered.

That unsettled him more than broken glass would have.

He picked it up. Dust clung to the frame. The hands were frozen at 2:17.

“Old thing,” Brett muttered.

He rehung it, gave it a small tap. Nothing moved.

As he turned away, something made him look upstairs.

Raj’s door was slightly open.

Brett climbed quietly and checked on him. Raj slept peacefully, his breathing slow and steady, his hands curled loosely at his chest.

Relief loosened Brett’s shoulders.

But as he stepped back, his eyes drifted—against his will—to the painting.

For a moment, he thought the faceless boy was looking at him.

He blinked.

The eyes were still gone.
  </p>

  <p>
    Morning came bright and sudden.

Sunlight poured into the apartment, sharp and unforgiving. Brett noticed the clock immediately.

Still 2:17.

Raj sat at the table, drawing.

Two figures holding hands.

One face unfinished.

“That clock fell last night,” Raj said without looking up.

“Yeah,” Brett replied, pouring coffee. “Probably just loose.”

“It fell because it wasn’t needed anymore,” Raj said softly.

Brett laughed, a little too loudly. “You’re starting to sound like an old man.”

Raj didn’t smile.
  </p>

  <p>
    Brett decided that afternoon had to mean something.

Raj had been quiet for days—not withdrawn exactly, but distant, as if his thoughts were always somewhere else. Brett told himself it was grief layered over change. Children didn’t always understand how to lose a parent and a home at the same time.

So he made a plan.

The playground came first. Raj hesitated at the swings, then climbed on. Brett pushed him gently at first, then higher. Raj laughed—really laughed—and Brett felt something in his chest loosen.

They went to the games corner next. Raj won a small plastic toy after three failed attempts and smiled with the kind of pride only children had. Ice cream followed. Raj chose vanilla, like always. It melted too fast, dripping onto his fingers, but he didn’t care.

For a while, Brett allowed himself to believe this had worked.

As they walked back, the city dipped into evening. Buildings glowed in dull orange light, shadows stretching long across the pavement. The sky looked heavy, as if rain might return.

That’s when Brett saw the clock shop.

Its window was crowded—too crowded. Wall clocks of every size and style pressed against the glass, their faces staring outward. Brett thought of the clock at home, frozen and dull.

“I’ll just get a new one,” he said casually.

Inside, the shop felt warmer than it should have been. The air was thick with dust and old wood. Clocks ticked, but not together—each one out of sync, creating a soft, uneven noise that crawled under Brett’s skin.

The shopkeeper spoke as Brett browsed, but Brett barely listened.

Raj wandered.

At first, he stayed close. Then something pulled him farther in.

It wasn’t a sound—not exactly. More like a sensation, a pressure behind his eyes. Raj’s steps slowed as he moved past rows of clocks until he reached the far end of the shop.

An old clock hung there.

Antique. Scratched. Forgotten.

Its glass was clouded, its frame darkened with age. The hands were frozen.

2:17.

Raj stopped.

His breathing slowed. His body went still, like he was afraid to move.

Behind him, Brett turned and felt panic surge.

“Raj?”

No answer.

The ticking around them felt louder now.

Brett rushed over and grabbed Raj’s shoulders. “Raj!”

Raj inhaled sharply, as if waking from deep water.

“Home,” he said instantly. His fingers clenched into Brett’s jacket. “Please. I don’t feel good.”

His voice trembled—not sick, not tired. Afraid.

Brett paid quickly and ushered him outside. As they stepped away, Brett glanced back once more.

“That clock,” he asked the shopkeeper. “The antique one.”

The man hesitated.

“Apartment 608,” he said. “Hollis Lane.”

Brett felt his stomach drop.

Before he could ask anything else, Raj screamed.

Not loud—but desperate.

“Don’t,” Raj cried. “Please don’t ask.”

Brett didn’t look back again.
  </p>

  <p>
    Back home, Raj went straight to his room.

“I’m tired,” he murmured.

Brett kissed his forehead, lingering longer than usual. Raj felt warm. Normal.

Brett told himself he was overthinking.

In his own room, the silence felt heavier than before. Brett sat on the edge of the bed and picked up the family photo. Jane’s smile looked unreal now—too alive for the quiet apartment.

“I’m doing my best,” Brett whispered.

His eyes burned. He wiped the tears away and lay down.

Sleep came slowly.

Then—

CRASH.

Glass shattered somewhere below.

Raj screamed.

Brett was already running.

The new clock lay broken at the foot of the stairs, its glass scattered like ice across the floor. Brett didn’t stop. He took the steps two at a time and burst into Raj’s room.

Raj was sitting in the corner of the bed, knees pulled to his chest, shaking violently.

“Raj—hey—it’s okay,” Brett said, pulling him close. “What happened?”

Raj lifted a trembling finger and pointed.

The painting.

“He was coming out,” Raj whispered. “The boy.”

Brett turned.

The painting was still. Silent. Torn.

Raj’s voice cracked. “He looked at me.”

Brett forced his breathing steady. “You had a nightmare.”

Raj shook his head. Tears streamed down his face. “He doesn’t like you.”

The words felt wrong. Too specific.

Brett carried Raj to his room and lay beside him until his breathing slowed. Raj clutched Brett’s shirt until sleep finally took him.

Later, Brett stepped back into the hallway.

He cleaned the shattered glass slowly, deliberately, as if moving too fast might break something else. When he picked up the broken clock, his hands froze.

The hands were stopped.

2:17.

Again.

Brett stared at it for a long time.

“Coincidence,” he whispered.

The apartment didn’t answer.

That night, Brett dreamed of a hallway that never ended. Doors lined the walls. From behind one, a small hand reached out—waiting.

In the other room, Raj slept facing the doorway, his eyes half open.

Time did not move.

And whatever waited inside Apartment 608 was no longer patient.
  </p>
    <p>
      After the disturbing night when the clock once again froze at 2:17, neither Brett nor Raj slept properly.
Brett lay awake for hours, staring at the ceiling, listening to the silence. Every small creak of the apartment made his muscles tighten. He kept telling himself it was exhaustion… stress… imagination.
But deep down, something felt wrong.
Raj, on the other hand, slept restlessly beside him, occasionally shifting, whispering faint things Brett couldn’t quite understand.
Still, morning came — indifferent and bright.
And it was important.
It was Raj’s admission day.
    </p>
    <p>
Morning – 7:00 A.M.
“Raj… wake up, champ,” Brett said softly, brushing his son’s hair back.
Raj opened his eyes slowly. For a moment, there was confusion in them. Then he remembered.
“School…” he murmured.
“Yes. Big day today.”
Raj nodded. He didn’t mention the painting. He didn’t mention the clock. And Brett didn’t ask.
Some silences are agreed upon without words.
The school building was lively and welcoming — children running, parents chatting, teachers smiling warmly. It felt normal. Safe.
Raj sat for the short evaluation test for second standard admission. Brett waited outside, pacing slightly.
When Raj came out, he looked calm. Too calm.
“How was it?” Brett asked.
“I knew everything,” Raj replied quietly.
Minutes later, a teacher approached them with a warm smile.
“Mr. Brett? Your son has done exceptionally well. He qualifies comfortably for second standard.”
Brett’s shoulders relaxed instantly.
“That’s… that’s wonderful,” he said, placing a hand proudly on Raj’s shoulder.
The teacher smiled at Raj.
“You’re very intelligent. Keep it up.”
Raj gave a small smile — polite, reserved.
On the way back home, Brett couldn’t hide his pride.
“I told you, didn’t I? You’re brilliant,” he said, laughing lightly.
Raj looked out the car window at the passing city.
“Dad… can we keep my room light on tonight?”
Brett’s smile faded just slightly.
“Of course,” he replied gently. “If that makes you comfortable.”
Raj nodded, still looking outside.
      </p>
    <p>
Back Home...
To manage work and ensure Raj wasn’t alone, Brett had hired a maid named Lisa.
Lisa was in her early thirties, kind-faced, soft-spoken — the type of person children trusted easily.
She opened the door with a warm smile.
“How did it go?”
“He’s in,” Brett said proudly.
“Oh! Congratulations, Raj!” Lisa said cheerfully. “I knew you’d do well.”
Raj gave her a small smile.
Lisa had quickly become a comforting presence in the house. She cooked, cleaned, helped Raj with reading, and sat beside him when he drew.
For the first time since moving into the apartment, things felt… stable.
For three consecutive days, nothing unusual happened.
Raj seemed engaged in his lessons. He spent hours drawing in his notebook — mostly houses, trees… and sometimes hands.
Brett noticed the hands once.
“Why only hands?” he asked casually.
Raj paused before answering.
“I just like drawing them.”
That was all he said.
Still, Brett felt relieved.
He could focus on his office work again. Meetings, reports, deadlines — the rhythm of normal life slowly returning.
One evening, he stood in the kitchen doorway and watched Lisa help Raj read.
“Thank you, Lisa,” Brett said sincerely. “I don’t know what I’d do without your help.”
Lisa smiled warmly.
“He’s a sweet child. Very quiet… but very observant.”
“Observant?” Brett asked.
“Yes,” she replied thoughtfully. “Sometimes I feel like he’s listening to something I can’t hear.”
Brett forced a small laugh.
“He’s just imaginative.”
Lisa nodded, though something in her eyes lingered for a second too long.
That night, as Brett passed by Raj’s room, he noticed the painting still hanging on the wall.
The torn face.
The unseen eyes.
The small painted hand reaching out of the frame.
For a brief moment, Brett could swear the shadow beneath the painting looked… slightly longer than before.
He blinked.
It was normal again.
Just a trick of light.
He told himself that.
And for three days, the apartment remained silent.
Too silent.
      </p>
    <p>
      On the third day, after breakfast, Brett adjusted Raj’s collar and kissed his forehead.
“Be good, alright?” he said gently.
Raj nodded. “You’ll come back before dark?”
“Of course,” Brett smiled. “And Lisa’s here with you.”
Raj’s fingers tightened slightly around the edge of the table, but he didn’t say anything.
As Brett stepped outside, locking the apartment door behind him, his eyes fell on something near the trash area.
The broken clock.
The one that had fallen from the stairs.
It was still there.
Cracked glass. Bent frame. Its hands frozen forever at 2:17.
A faint discomfort passed through him.
“The garbage truck probably didn’t come,” he muttered to himself.
Still… three days?
He shook the thought away and left for work.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Long Day...
Work was exhausting. Meetings stretched longer than expected, emails piled up, and yet Brett’s mind kept drifting back.
Back to the clock.
Back to that exact time.
2:17.
Why that time?
Why twice?
Why every time?
As he drove home in the evening, lost in thought, he passed the familiar wall clock shop.
His grip tightened on the steering wheel.
He slowed down.
Then stopped.
If the seller of the apartment refused to say anything about its past… maybe someone else would.
He parked.
      The bell above the door chimed softly as Brett entered.
The shopkeeper looked up and smiled in recognition.
“Ah! Back again?”
“Yes,” Brett replied politely. “Thought I’d drop by.”
They exchanged small talk for a moment — the weather, business, rising prices, the usual.
      Brett stood there for a moment, staring at the antique clock in the far corner of the shop.
It still read 2:17.
The shopkeeper noticed his silence.
“You seem attached to that clock,” he said lightly.
Brett forced a small smile. “Yeah… it’s strange. It keeps stopping at the same time.”
The keeper shrugged. “Old clocks do that. Faulty mechanism.”
Brett hesitated… then leaned forward slightly.
“Listen,” he said, lowering his voice—not in fear, but in uncertainty. “Do you happen to know anything about Apartment 608? The one I recently moved into?”
The shopkeeper stiffened a little.
“Why do you ask?”
“I just…” Brett exhaled slowly. “I’ve been having trouble sleeping. My son too. And the previous owner refused to tell me anything about the place. If there’s something I should know… I’d rather know it.”
The keeper waved a dismissive hand. “Oh no, no. Nothing like that. Old buildings always have stories. People exaggerate.”
Brett didn’t leave.
He stayed there quietly.
“Please,” he said after a pause. “If you’ve heard something… I’d prefer the truth over rumors.”
The keeper studied him for a few seconds. Then he sighed.
“Alright. But it’s just talk from years ago. Nothing official.”
He wiped the counter slowly as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
“About ten years back, a woman lived there. Kept to herself. Had a daughter—maybe nineteen or twenty. They weren’t social. That’s all.”
Brett nodded. “What happened to them?”
“There was a fire,” the keeper replied calmly. “Short circuit, they said. By the time the fire brigade arrived, it was too late. Tragic.”
“That’s it?” Brett asked.
The shopkeeper hesitated—not dramatically, just thoughtfully.
“Well… neighbors used to say the woman was strict. Overprotective. Didn’t let the girl mix much. People talk, you know how it is.”
Brett remained silent, waiting.
The keeper sighed again, realizing Brett wouldn’t leave.
“Fine. Some said she had a temper. That she would shout. Maybe even punish the girl harshly. But there was never proof of anything. Just gossip.”
Brett swallowed. “And the daughter?”
“They assumed she died in the fire too,” the keeper said gently. “The structure collapsed badly. Identification wasn’t… clear.”
There was no eerie tone. No whisper. Just matter-of-fact sadness.
After a moment, the shopkeeper added almost casually—
“She used to buy clocks from me. Strange hobby. Every month, a new wall clock. That antique one you’re asking about? That came from her house.”
He chuckled lightly. “Doesn’t even work properly. I keep meaning to fix it.”
Brett looked at the clock again.
Still 2:17.
He nodded slowly. “Thank you. I appreciate you telling me.”
“No need to worry,” the keeper said. “Old places just have old memories.”
Brett managed a faint smile.
“Yeah,” he replied. “That’s all it is.”
Brett opened his mouth as if to ask something more.
Then stopped.
Some questions feel dangerous once spoken aloud.
He forced a polite nod.
“Thank you.”
      Outside, the evening sky was dimming into a dull orange-grey.
The world looked normal.
Too normal.
On his way home, Brett stopped at a small roadside stall.
He bought pancakes and dumplings — Raj’s favorites.
“If I’m thinking too much,” he told himself, “at least tonight will be peaceful.”
      For a moment, he convinced himself that everything he had heard was nothing more than coincidence.
And yet…
As he walked past his apartment building, he couldn’t shake the feeling that the house was waiting for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, Brett unlocked the apartment door with his shoulder, balancing a grocery bag in one hand.
He heard voices inside.
Raj’s laughter.
Lisa’s softer tone responding.
Normal.
Warm.
He stepped in.
The lights were already on. Not bright — just enough to soften the corners of the room.
Raj was sitting cross-legged near the coffee table, explaining something about a spaceship made of building blocks.
Lisa listened attentively, elbows resting on her knees, head slightly tilted — as if she had nowhere else to be.
“You’re back!” Raj said, running over.
Brett smiled. “What are we building today?”
“A launch station,” Raj replied. “Lisa said this house would make a good one.”
Brett raised an eyebrow playfully. “Oh?”
Lisa folded the last shirt and placed it neatly on the stack.
“I said it has strong walls,” she corrected gently. “Old construction. They built things to last.”
Her tone was light.
Informational.
Nothing strange about that.
In the kitchen, Brett opened a cabinet to grab plates.
Lisa was already beside him.
She reached up — not hesitating — and took down two plates from the shelf above.
The correct shelf.
He paused.
“I didn’t tell you where those were,” he said casually.
“You didn’t have to,” she replied with a faint smile. “Most kitchens are arranged the same way.”
Maybe.
He hadn’t thought about it.
She moved easily through the space — not exploring, not snooping — just navigating.
Like someone who learns layouts quickly.
Later, Brett was searching for the small toolbox.
He checked the hall closet.
Nothing.
He muttered something under his breath.
“Laundry cabinet,” Lisa said from the living room.
He looked at her.
“Top shelf, right side.”
He found it exactly there.
He tried to remember moving it.
Maybe he had.
“You’ve got a good memory,” he said.
She shrugged slightly. “I notice where things are.”
That was true.
Some people just did.
    </p>
      <p>
        It began small.
Small enough that Brett didn’t think to question it immediately.
One afternoon, he found Raj standing on a chair near the living room wall.
The wall where the painting hung.
Raj’s fingers were resting lightly against the plaster just below the frame.
“What are you doing?” Brett asked.
Raj didn’t turn around.
“Listening.”
“To what?”
Raj tilted his head slightly, as if concentrating.“They used to stand here.”
“Who did?”
Raj finally looked at him.
“Lisa said they used to watch from this side. It’s quieter here.”
Brett felt something tighten in his chest.
“Watch what?”
Raj shrugged. “The room.”
Brett glanced toward the kitchen.
Lisa was rinsing dishes, back turned, humming softly.
“Did Lisa tell you that?” Brett asked carefully.
Raj nodded. “When you were at work.”
Brett stepped down from the chair and gently lifted Raj off it.
“Okay,” he said lightly. “No more climbing.”
Raj accepted that easily.Children repeat things all the time.
Maybe she’d meant something else.Maybe he misunderstood.
A few days later—
Brett woke in the middle of the night.He heard soft footsteps in the hallway.
Not heavy.
Not hurried.
Measured.
He stepped out of his bedroom and saw Raj standing near the front door.
Barefoot.Staring at the lock.
“Raj?” Raj didn’t respond immediately.
“What are you doing?”
Raj spoke quietly.
“She said this door was stronger before.”
Brett frowned. “Who said?”
Raj blinked slowly, as if waking up.
“Lisa.”
The hallway light flickered faintly.
Brett crouched down. “When did she say that?”Raj looked confused now.
“I don’t know.”
“Was she talking about our door?”
Raj hesitated.
“No.”A pause.
“Another one.”
Brett felt his mouth go dry.
“Go back to bed,” he said gently.Raj obeyed without argument.
In the morning, Raj remembered none of it.
Lisa said she had slept through the night.
Her tone was calm.
Not defensive.
Another time—
Raj was drawing at the table.Brett leaned over to look.
The drawing showed a rectangle on a wall.
Inside it, stick figures.
Not trapped.Just standing.
“How many are there?” Brett asked.
Raj counted softly.
“Two.”
“Who are they?”
Raj tapped the paper.
“They stay behind.” “Behind what?”
“The door.”
Brett felt the room grow a degree colder.
“What door?”
Raj looked puzzled.
“The one that isn’t open yet.”
Brett swallowed.
“Did Lisa tell you about that?”
Raj frowned.
“No.”
He hesitated.
Then added quietly—
“She just said they used to wait.”
Brett looked toward the kitchen.
Lisa was standing near the sink.
Not watching them.
Not listening.
Just drying a plate.
That evening, Brett asked her casually,
“Do you tell Raj stories about the house?”
She smiled faintly. “Sometimes he asks about old buildings. Children are curious.”
“Do you tell him about… people who lived here?”
Her hands paused for only a fraction of a second before continuing.
“I don’t know who lived here,” she said.
It wasn’t defensive.
It wasn’t emotional.
It was simply stated.
Brett studied her for a moment.
There was nothing in her face.
No fear.
No guilt.
Just quiet.
He nodded.
“Right.”
Later that night—
Raj stood in the hallway again.
But this time he wasn’t moving.
Just looking at the antique clock.
Brett approached slowly.
“Why are you staring at it?”
Raj answered softly:
“She said it doesn’t like being watched.”
Brett’s heartbeat stumbled.
“Who said that?”
Raj’s eyes remained on the clock.
“Lisa.”
Behind them—
A floorboard shifted.
Brett turned sharply.
Lisa was in the kitchen doorway.
“Bedtime,” she said gently.
Raj blinked.
As if something released him.
He walked past her without another word.
Brett stared at her.
“You said that to him?”
She looked genuinely confused.
“Said what?”
“That the clock doesn’t like being watched.”
A slight crease formed between her brows.
“I don’t think I’d say that.”
The silence stretched.
Then she added softly—
“It’s just a clock.”
And walked away.
